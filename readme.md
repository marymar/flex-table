# Flex Table

[experimental]

Just a little flex example, where data is stored in table- like order for bigger viewports.
But in smaller vieports widths columns header can be seperatly configured
 and for the data rows too.
 
The configuration is done by the mixin `create-flex-block`.
It expects a map with the structure of the flex 'table' for
each breakpoint.

## Examples

- order-table
- todo

Both examples are available in the index.htm

## Build
