# Flex Table

Just a little flex example, where data is stored in table
like order for bigger viewports.
In smaller vieports widths columns header can be seperatly configured
 and the same is true for the data itself.
 
The configuration is done by the mixin `create-flex-block`.
It expects a map with the structure of the flex 'table' for
each breakpoint.

## Examples
